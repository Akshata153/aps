                Elasticsearch with TF-IDF.<br />
                Elasticsearch with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document
                Frequency) is a widely used search engine technology that
                indexes and retrieves documents based on relevance scores
                calculated using TF-IDF.
                <br />Limitations:<br />TF-IDF computes document similarity
                directly in the word-count space, which can be slow for large
                vocabularies. TF-IDF does not consider the semantic meaning of
                words: it cannot understand the context of the words and derive
                their meaning. Moreover, it fails to define semantic links
                between words.
              </p>

                Trie-based Search.<br />
                Trie-based search is a data structure that efficiently stores
                and retrieves strings. It is particularly useful for searching
                for substrings within a large corpus of text.
              </p>

              <ul class="myul">
              <p class="abc2">
                Trie-based search algorithms can potentially address some of the
                limitations of TF-IDF used in Elasticsearch.

              <ol>
                <li class="myli">
                  Speed and Efficiency:
                  <ul>
                    <li class="myli">
                      TF-IDF Limitation: TF-IDF calculates document similarity
                      based on word frequencies and inverse document
                      frequencies, which can be computationally intensive for
                      large vocabularies and documents.
                    </li>
                    <li class="myli">
                      Trie-based Solution: Trie structures are efficient for
                      prefix matching, allowing for faster retrieval of terms
                      compared to traditional inverted indices used in TF-IDF.
                      This efficiency can speed up search operations, especially
                      in scenarios with large datasets.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="myli">
                  Semantic Understanding and Context:
                  <ul>
                    <li class="myli">
                      TF-IDF Limitation: TF-IDF operates primarily on
                      statistical measures (word frequencies and document
                      frequencies) without directly capturing semantic
                      relationships or understanding the contextual meaning of
                      words.
                    </li>
                    <li class="myli">
                      Trie-based Solution: While tries themselves do not
                      inherently add semantic understanding, they can facilitate
                      more nuanced search functionalities. By structuring data
                      hierarchically based on prefixes, tries can potentially be
                      extended or combined with semantic analysis techniques.
                    </li>

                  Semantic Links Between Words:
                  <ul>
                    <li class="myli">
                      TF-IDF Limitation: TF-IDF does not establish semantic
                      links between words, which limits its ability to handle
                      synonyms, related terms, or contextually similar terms
                      effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li class="myli">
                      Trie-based Solution: Tries can be designed to incorporate
                      relationships between terms or augmentations that capture
                      semantic links. For instance, by linking nodes in a trie
                      with related terms or by integrating semantic embeddings
                      into the trie structure, it's possible to enhance search
                      results by considering synonyms or related concepts.

              <h3>Why use trie?</h3>
              <p>
                To fully leverage the benefits of trie-based search and address
                the semantic limitations of TF-IDF, integration with semantic
                technologies or enhanced data structures (like graph databases
                for semantic relationships) would be necessary. This hybrid
                approach could combine the efficiency of trie-based indexing
                with the semantic richness required for understanding context
                and meaning in text-based searches.<br />While trie-based search
                algorithms offer advantages such as efficient substring searches
                and faster prefix matching, they also come with certain
                limitations:<br />Memory Usage: Tries can consume a significant
                amount of memory, especially for large datasets. Each node in
                the trie represents a character, and for datasets with a vast
                vocabulary or long strings, the memory overhead can be
                substantial.

                <br />
                Time Complexity: Although tries excel in prefix matching and
                substring searches, their time complexity can be higher compared
                to other data structures like hash tables or binary search
                trees, especially when dealing with very large datasets.
              </p>
              <h4 class="myh4">Conclusion:</h4>
              <p>
                While trie-based search is powerful for specific substring and
                prefix matching tasks, Elasticsearch with TF-IDF remains a
                preferred choice for many applications due to its overall
                efficiency, scalability, and feature-rich capabilities in
                handling large-scale text search and retrieval operation
